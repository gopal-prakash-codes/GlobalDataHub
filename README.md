# Django-Poll-App

Only the owner of a poll can add poll , edit poll, update poll, delete poll , add choice, update choice, delete choice and end a poll. If a poll is ended it can not be voted. Ended poll only shows user the final result of the poll. There is a search option for polls. Also user can filter polls by name, publish date, and by number of voted. Pagination will work even after applying filter.
